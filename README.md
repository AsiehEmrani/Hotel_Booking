# Hotel_Booking
I have implemented a reservation system with python and Django Rest Framework(DRF). To test this, I advise using a swagger URL. After you download the project, you must install the required packages( these are in the requirement file) and then just run the project. The swagger URL is
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/schema/swagger.  
Some parts of the project are usable just for the admin user, these parts include room, hotel, and user. The value of admin username is admin and password is admin too.
